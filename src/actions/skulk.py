  description = "When you skulk, you move stealthily or without being noticed. You might sneak past security or hide in the shadows. You might lift a cred-stick off a mark. You might sneak up behind someone to attack them by surprise (but scrap might be better). You could try to climb up the side of a building (but scramble might be better)."
