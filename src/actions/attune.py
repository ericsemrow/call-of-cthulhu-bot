  description = "When you attune to the Way, you open your mind to the galactic energies flowing throughout existence. You might communicate with a non-sentient species or robot. You could safely handle Precursor artifacts or remnants that tap directly into the Way. You might sense unseen danger, or killing intent (though study might be better)."
