  title = "{name} is rolling {#} Helm die"
  description = "When you helm, you pilot a vehicle or use vehicle weapons. You might plot a jump through a dark hyperspace lane. You might dive through a canyon to escape a chasing ship. You might fire quad-lasers at hostile pirates. You might reroute power on the ship to weather fire (though rig may be better)."
