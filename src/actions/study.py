  description = "When you study, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence. You might gather information from documents, newsfeeds, and books. You might do research on an esoteric topic. You could try to examine events to understand a pressing situation. You might closely analyze a person to detect lies or true feelings (but consort might be better). You could deduce a personâ€™s intention to kill you (but attune might be better)."
