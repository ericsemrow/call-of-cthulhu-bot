  title = "{name} is rolling {#} Scramble die"
  description = "When you scramble, you lift, climb, jump, run, or swim, usually either away from or into danger. You might vault over a turnstile while escaping authorities. You might climb up the side of a cliff to approach a secret base. You might dodge blaster fire as you cross the hanger to get to your ship. You might chase after a mark you're following (though skulk may be better)."
