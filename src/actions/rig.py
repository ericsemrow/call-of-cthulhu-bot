  title = "{name} is rolling {#} Rig die"
  description = "When you rig mechanisms, you alter how an existing mechanism works or create a new one. You might disable a trap. You might repair a damaged ship system. You might crack a safe. You might overdrive an engine. You might program a bomb to detonate later. You might force a door open (though hack might be better)."
